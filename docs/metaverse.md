## What

**Think _Uber meets Pok√©mon Go_.**

See the [main README](https://github.com/ArcadeCity/arcade/blob/main/README.md) for our project overview.

Arcade City benefits from the intersection of three innovations:

- A new **money**: Bitcoin
- A new **model**: Platform cooperativism
- A new **medium**: Mixed reality

## A Bitcoin-Powered Metaverse

The metaverse does not belong to shitcoiners.

Imagine an open metaverse backed by a decentralized network of Bitcoin nodes.

Our version of these nodes, called Arcade relay nodes, will host content like 3D assets in exchange for sats, while also doubling as Bitcoin & Lightning nodes.

Therefore the growth of the metaverse will incentivize the strengthening of the Bitcoin network &mdash; and vice versa.

See [Bitcoinizing Arcade City](bitcoinizing.md) for more of our thoughts on Bitcoin/Lightning architecture.

## Oasis vs. Arcade

Contrasting the Oasis from Ready Player One with the Arcade:

|           | The Oasis          | The Arcade             |
| --------- | ------------------ | ---------------------- |
| Ownership | Single corporation | Multi-stakeholder      |
| Immersion | Entirely virtual   | Mixed reality          |
| Emphasis  | Escapism           | Real-world empowerment |
| Code      | Closed-source      | Open-source            |
| Currency  | Corporate shitcoin | Bitcoin                |
