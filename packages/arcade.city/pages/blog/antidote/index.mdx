Forcing ourselves to write up a short announcement post for every project we work on acts as a built-in quality check, making sure that we never call a project "done" until we feel comfortable telling the world it's out there. The problem was that up until today, we didn't actually have anywhere to publish those posts!`,

"We tried voluntary.... The voluntary phase is over."

So [declared](https://youtu.be/UdIpGnwu8T0?t=387) the mayor of America's largest city last week, introducing a new slew of government
mandates to "protect our people".

Authoritarians love a crisis. Especially if it never ends.

"You never want a serious crisis to go to waste," [said](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mzcbXi1Tkk) another of America's big-city mayors. "And what I mean by that is it's
an opportunity to do things you think you could not do before."

Aging centralized powers will use any excuse to expand their control:
terrorism, climate change, global pandemics. All serious issues, none
of which the old governments are best positioned to solve.

To a bureaucracy with a hammer, everything looks like a nail. The
elites' fake solutions will always empower and enrich themselves at
the expense of everyone else.

We don't have to go along with it.

They may assume our consent. But consent can be withdrawn at any time.
Anything less is slavery.

We can exit their systems &mdash; and build our own.

## A new city

New technology makes possible new forms of social organization.

Arguably the greatest invention of the 21st century is [Bitcoin](https://bitcoin.org/),
the world’s first open monetary system accessible to everyone with
an internet connection.

Finally we have a reliable, digital, global form of money outside the
control of governments.

The authority of coercive governments stems from their two monopolies:
on the issuance of money and on “legitimate” violence.

As both digital gold and peer-to-peer cash, Bitcoin is increasingly
ending governments’ monopoly on money.

The inevitable result is that Bitcoin will also end the old powers’
monopoly on violence, through which their elites get away with mass
murder, theft and corruption.

Bitcoin provides a secure base layer that can support high-integrity
social relationships spanning trade, finance, contracts,
communication, and even governance.

On top of that strong foundation, there is [now forming an entire stack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlV5_udJkC0)
of layers extending the security of Bitcoin to every imaginable form
of peer-to-peer interaction.

When free people migrate their relationships and organizations into a
global ecosystem built on Bitcoin, the old systems will lose their
power to lie, cheat and steal.

This will happen in our lifetimes. For the sake of our children and
the future of our planet, it must.

On top of Bitcoin will be built an open ecosystem with millions of
service providers offering peer-to-peer everything — for everyone.

We’re calling it <span className="font-bold text-pinkflamingo">THE ARCADE</span> &mdash; and you will be welcome there.

Stay tuned.
