  description: `One of the things we believe as a team is that everything we make should be sealed with a blog post. Forcing ourselves to write up a short announcement post for every project we work on acts as a built-in quality check, making sure that we never call a project "done" until we feel comfortable telling the world it's out there. The problem was that up until today, we didn't actually have anywhere to publish those posts!`,

To get the most out of Tailwind, you need a build step. It's the only way to be able to customize your [`tailwind.config.js`](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/configuration) file, extract components with [`@apply`](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/functions-and-directives#apply), or include [plugins](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/plugins).

This isn't a problem if you've already bought in to the framework, but if you're just trying to kick the tires for the first time it's a lot of friction. You either have to set up a local development environment with PostCSS support, or stick to the static CDN build, which means you lose out on lots of cool features.

So today we're excited to release the first version of [**Tailwind Play**](https://play.tailwindcss.com), an advanced online playground for Tailwind CSS that lets you use all of Tailwind's build-time features directly in the browser.

</div>

It includes support for all of Tailwind's coolest features, plus tons of stuff that's even better in Tailwind Play than it is in your editor, like:

- Customizing your Tailwind theme
- Enabling special variants, like `group-hover` or `focus-within`
- Using custom directives in your CSS like `@apply`, `@variants`, and `@responsive`
- Adding plugins like `@tailwindcss/typography`
- Intelligent code completion and linting
- Responsive design mode
- One-click sharing

The code completion even updates the rendered preview in _real-time_, which creates an incredible design workflow in the browser â€” just navigate through different padding utilities with the arrow keys for example to find the perfect value without ever saving the file or even hitting enter!
