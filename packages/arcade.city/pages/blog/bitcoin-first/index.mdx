Forcing ourselves to write up a short announcement post for every project we work on acts as a built-in quality check, making sure that we never call a project "done" until we feel comfortable telling the world it's out there. The problem was that up until today, we didn't actually have anywhere to publish those posts!`,

  We are pivoting to build on Bitcoin.

  All serious builders should do the same.

You there! Are you most excited about...

- Trading JPEGs?
- Disappearing forever into virtual worlds?
- Turning one dollar into two as fast as possible?

This is not for you.

Institutions of the old world are [collapsing](https://twitter.com/prestonjbyrne/status/1426546297050472454) before our eyes.

Millions of people now suffer for lack of alternatives to those systems &mdash; a number sure grow as the old systems destabilize and die.

A new world must be built. Not later &mdash; now.

The contours of this emerging world are becoming clear:

- War will be [obsolete](https://twitter.com/JasonPLowery/status/1427357440773918720).
- Wealth will be [un-stealable](https://twitter.com/MsHodl/status/1426556209339912197).
- Authoritarianism will be <Link href='/blog/antidote'>abolished</Link>.
- Nation-states will be [decentralized or dissolved](https://twitter.com/woonomic/status/1427172525100912640).
- All people will be [included](https://twitter.com/jack/status/1426521682538344451).

All because of [Bitcoin](https://bitcoin.org/) and its supporters.

Now you have a choice to make: **_Will you help?_**

## Our Bitcoin Strategy

Lightning Network enables fast and instant payments.

Our "lightning bulb" moment was watching Jack Mallers' talk. Oh: this is no longer
theoretical. This is directly impacting people's lives now.

Great. But can it help our use case?

We've been saying since 2016 we want to decentralize the gig economy on Ethereum.
We fell for the early hype that Ethereum would power decentralized Uber, be the world
computer and other things. If we had a time machine, hey uh in 5 years there will be
no way to feasibly implement that in a way that actually makes sense for riders + drivers.
