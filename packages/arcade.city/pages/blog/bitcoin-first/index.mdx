Forcing ourselves to write up a short announcement post for every project we work on acts as a built-in quality check, making sure that we never call a project "done" until we feel comfortable telling the world it's out there. The problem was that up until today, we didn't actually have anywhere to publish those posts!`,

  We are pivoting to build on Bitcoin.
  <br />
  All serious builders should do the same.
</p>

Old-world institutions are [collapsing](https://twitter.com/prestonjbyrne/status/1426546297050472454) before our eyes.

Millions of people suffer for lack of alternatives to the old systems &mdash; a number sure to grow as instability spreads.

A new world must be built **now**.

Contours of that new world are becoming clear:

- War will be [obsolete](https://twitter.com/JasonPLowery/status/1427357440773918720).
- Wealth will be [un-stealable](https://twitter.com/MsHodl/status/1426556209339912197).
- Authoritarianism will be <Link href='/blog/antidote'>abolished</Link>.
- Nation-states will be [decentralized or dissolved](https://twitter.com/woonomic/status/1427172525100912640).
- All people will be [included](https://twitter.com/jack/status/1426521682538344451).

Because of [Bitcoin](https://bitcoin.org/) and its supporters.

You now have a choice to make: **_Will you help?_**

## Our Bitcoin Strategy

The sole focus of Arcade City [since 2016](https://blog.arcade.city/celebrating-three-years-of-arcade-city-19cb44ee26fd)
has been **unstoppable peer-to-peer commerce**.

The core principle of Arcade City is the freedom to choose who and how to relate
to each other. Any two consenting adults have a moral right to connect
with each other however they choose. Any contracts they create - whether for a ride or
delivery or homeshare or dance or anything else - are strictly private and no one else's
business.

Lightning Network enables fast and instant payments.

Our "lightning bulb" moment was watching Jack Mallers' talk. Oh: this is no longer
theoretical. This is directly impacting people's lives now.

Great. But can it help our use case?

We've been saying since 2016 we want to decentralize the gig economy on Ethereum.
We fell for the early hype that Ethereum would power decentralized Uber, be the world
computer and other things. If we had a time machine, hey uh in 5 years there will be
no way to feasibly implement that in a way that actually makes sense for riders + drivers.
