Forcing ourselves to write up a short announcement post for every project we work on acts as a built-in quality check, making sure that we never call a project "done" until we feel comfortable telling the world it's out there. The problem was that up until today, we didn't actually have anywhere to publish those posts!`,

  We are pivoting to build on Bitcoin.
  <br />
  All serious builders should do the same.
</p>

Old-world institutions are [collapsing](https://twitter.com/prestonjbyrne/status/1426546297050472454) before our eyes.

Millions of people suffer for lack of alternatives to the old systems &mdash; a number sure to grow as instability spreads.

A new world must be built **now**.

Contours of that new world are becoming clear:

- War will be [obsolete](https://twitter.com/JasonPLowery/status/1427357440773918720).
- Wealth will be [un-stealable](https://twitter.com/MsHodl/status/1426556209339912197).
- Authoritarianism will be <Link href='/blog/antidote'>abolished</Link>.
- Nation-states will be [decentralized or dissolved](https://twitter.com/woonomic/status/1427172525100912640).
- All people will be [included](https://twitter.com/jack/status/1426521682538344451).

You now have a choice to make: **_Will you help?_**

## Our Bitcoin Strategy

The sole focus of Arcade City [since 2016](https://blog.arcade.city/celebrating-three-years-of-arcade-city-19cb44ee26fd)
has been **unstoppable peer-to-peer commerce**.

Our core principle: Any two consenting adults should be able to connect peer-to-peer
and transact however they want. They [need no one's permission](https://www.facebook.com/Entryist/posts/2045117542311863).

This is the hill we are prepared to die on.
