## Metaverse Money

From corporate treasuries to governments, from the energy industry to the political realm, Bitcoin's conquest of the physical world is accelerating.

Already on track to become the reserve currency of the world, Bitcoin is also best positioned to be the reserve currency of the metaverse.

<!-- What is the metaverse? It has no single definition. -->

In his article [Bitcoin Unlocks The Economy Of The Metaverse](https://thebitcoinlayer.substack.com/p/metaverse), author Nik Bhatia defines the metaverse as connective tissue for the internet's many virtual economies:

> The metaverse brings these worlds together. It’s a way of referring to the internet’s economy; a borderless bazaar of the weird and wonderful that can only exist virtually, and which may prove, in time, larger than the global economy itself. People who create content for the internet—bloggers, podcasters, YouTube personalities, Twitch streamers, and TikTok phenoms—are participants in the metaverse, as are their followers. What then is the potential size of the metaverse’s economy? Today, online commerce is still shackled by banking relics, but the limit has no bounds with bitcoin.

Bitcoin provides four crucial ingredients not found anywhere else:

1. A common denomination: "money for the internet"
2. Microtransactions via Lightning
3. Decentralized identity
4. Censorship resistance

With these building blocks from Bitcoin, what can we build?

## The Open Metaverse

In his 2019 talk [Foundational Principles & Technologies for the Metaverse](https://hackmd.io/@XR/tim-metaverse), Epic Games founder & CEO Tim Sweeney introduced the idea of the **open metaverse**:

> It’s a realtime 3D social medium where people can create and engage in shared experience as equal participants in an economy with societal impact. ... If this is a small thing and it fails, then it’s not the Metaverse. The Metaverse has to be a next-generation platform that’s a successor to a lot of communication media that came before it and has to take off at an unprecedented scale.

The key phrase there is **equal participants**. Because otherwise, Sweeney says, this new medium could be:

> ...a potential invitation for a corporate dystopia like we have with a lot of the social media platforms now where one company sucks all the money out or most of it, and has the unilateral right to decide what can and should be seen in the thing.

To preserve Sweeney's idea of "metaverse as an open platform", capture by corporations must be avoided at all costs.

That will require building on Bitcoin &mdash; specifically, layers [one](https://bitcoin.org/), [two](https://lightning.network/), and [three](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoM4Wx8er3Y).

## Bitcoin First & Only

Capture by "crypto" must be avoided too.

If the metaverse shouldn't be run by Facebook, it also shouldn't be "run" by the leading platform for scams, fraud, hacks, and theft.

Nor should it be run by any other VC-backed shitcoins offering all the same bad incentives except faster and cheaper.

It is time for serious builders to leave the shitcoin casinos behind and prioritize <Link href="/blog/bitcoin-first">Bitcoin First</Link>.

## Team Bitcoin

Uniting around Bitcoin offers a massive advantage: the incentives of all Bitcoiners are aligned. We are all incentivized in Bitcoin's success &mdash; and in each others' success.

Contrast this with the shitcoin "communities" in which thousands of projects each shill their own tokens. They compete for a limited pool of token speculators, with little incentive to collaborate.

We speak from experience. During the 2017-18 ICO hype cycle, about 20 different projects launched withs claims that they would "decentralize ridesharing" via Ethereum.

Our flagship rideshare network Arcade City Austin had been the leading "decentralized Uber" alternative [active since 2016](https://twitter.com/ArcadeCityHall/status/1271923227472932928) with hundreds of drivers and thousands of riders &mdash; yet not a single project reached out to us to collaborate.

That's because the incentives of the ICO people were to ignore all other projects, pretend to be the leader, and stick their hands out for money via half-baked websites and whitepapers. Those projects largely disappeared with millions of dollars raised, no products delivered, and no rides given. What a waste &mdash; all because of bad incentives.

Our experience so far in the Bitcoin community has been the complete opposite, with rapid collaboration via Twitter and Telegram and <Link href="/blog/onlysats">hackathons</Link>. No need to negotiate token ponzinomics or complex integrations between Rube Goldberg machines with broad attack surfaces. Just straightforward collaboration that moves the ecosystem forward.

When incentives are aligned, magic happens.

## The Arcade

How might a Bitcoin-powered open metaverse take shape?

We [posit](https://github.com/ArcadeCity/arcade/blob/main/docs/metaverse.md) that one implementation could involve a decentralized network of Bitcoin nodes running something like [Impervious](https://www.impervious.ai/), hosting content like 3D assets in exchange for Bitcoin micropayments (sats) transferred over Lightning.

Specific architecture we are only beginning to [spec out](https://github.com/ArcadeCity/arcade/blob/main/docs/bitcoinizing.md) &mdash; and we welcome community feedback and involvement.

We are more clear on the bigger picture of what the Arcade fundamentally **is**. Fun to compare it to the "Oasis" metaverse from Ready Player One.

|               | **The Oasis**      | **The Arcade**         |
| ------------- | ------------------ | ---------------------- |
| **Ownership** | Single corporation | Multi-stakeholder      |
| **Immersion** | Entirely virtual   | Mixed reality; AR > VR |
| **Emphasis**  | Escapism           | Real-world empowerment |
| **Code**      | Closed-source      | Open-source            |
| **Currency**  | Corporate shitcoin | Bitcoin                |

We do not want to build an escapist VR playground.

We do want to build a fun and fulfilling context for meaningful action in a bitcoinized world.

Our core mission centers on **unstoppable peer-to-peer commerce and connection**.

Transportation, deliveries, housing, food, finance, energy, infrastructure, governance: we believe all can and should be provided peer-to-peer with no government involvement.

Because governments are broken &mdash; and all people deserve to exit broken systems.

So let's build the destination they can exit to.

## LFG

Anyone interested to help, we recommend starting with Tim Sweeney's [2019 talk](https://hackmd.io/@XR/tim-metaverse) in which he dives deep into the dynamics and architecture of the open metaverse.

In future blog posts (and tweets - [follow us!](https://twitter.com/ArcadeCityHall)) we'll be exploring topics covered in that talk like virtual item economies, game engines, multiplayer networking, web vs. mobile, file formats, and other nerdy goodness.

One idea: both Bitcoin Core and Unreal Engine (the 3D engine created by Sweeney's company Epic Games) are written in open-source C++ code. How might those connect with each other?

## Ready for Freedom

Inevitably people will continue to cite Ready Player One ad nauseam when discussing the metaverse.

We'll need to remind people that other visions are possible.

For a compelling vision of an augmented-reality metaverse very relevant to our times, please read the excellent novel [FreedomTM](https://www.amazon.com/Freedom-TM-Daemon-Daniel-Suarez/dp/0451231899/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=freedom+tm&qid=1551464531&s=gateway&sr=8-1) by Daniel Suarez.

We leave you with an excerpt:

> Sebeck was speechless.
>
> "What did you think we were building out here, a casino?"
>
> "But what you're describing - creating water and pulling liquid fuel out of the air--"
>
> "The sun is what made life on Earth possible to begin with. Oil is just ancient solar energy stored in hydrocarbons. The CR5 technology was developed nearby in Sandia National Labs. It stands for 'Counter Rotating Ring Receiver Reactor Recuperators.' The details are available to anyone on the darknet, if you're really interested."
>
> He was still shaking his head. "Then why isn't this being done _everywhere_?"
>
> She turned off her D-Space layer and the lofty tower and virtual buildings disappeared. "Many things are possible, Sergeant, but not economically feasible. Of course, that all depends on how you calculate costs. Darknet communities factor in loss of economic independence as a cost. They factor in the cost of forcibly defending distant energy resources. They also factor in lack of sustainability and disposal of pollutants. That more than balances the equation. With this facility we'll use solar energy as the foundation of a long-term sustainable, energy-positive holon. And that's the goal."
>
> "A _holon_."
>
> "Holons are the geographic structure of the darknet. Any darknet community lies at the center of an economic radius of one hundred miles for its key inputs and outputs - food, energy, health care, and building materials. Balancing inputs and outputs within that circle is the goal. A local economy that's as self-sufficient as possible while still being part of a cultural whole - a holon - thus creating a resilient civilization that has no central points of failure. And which through its very structure promotes democracy. That's what we're doing here, Sergeant."
