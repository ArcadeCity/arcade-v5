## Metaverse Money

From corporate treasuries to governments, from the energy industry to the political realm, Bitcoin's conquest of the physical world is accelerating.

Already on track to become the reserve currency of the world, Bitcoin is also best positioned to be the reserve currency of the metaverse.

<!-- What is the metaverse? It has no single definition. -->

In his article [Bitcoin Unlocks The Economy Of The Metaverse](https://thebitcoinlayer.substack.com/p/metaverse), author Nik Bhatia defines the metaverse as connective tissue for the internet's many virtual economies:

> The metaverse brings these worlds together. It’s a way of referring to the internet’s economy; a borderless bazaar of the weird and wonderful that can only exist virtually, and which may prove, in time, larger than the global economy itself. People who create content for the internet—bloggers, podcasters, YouTube personalities, Twitch streamers, and TikTok phenoms—are participants in the metaverse, as are their followers. What then is the potential size of the metaverse’s economy? Today, online commerce is still shackled by banking relics, but the limit has no bounds with bitcoin.

Bitcoin provides four crucial ingredients not found anywhere else:

1. A common denomination: "money for the internet"
2. Microtransactions via Lightning
3. Decentralized identity
4. Censorship resistance

With these building blocks Bitcoin gives us, what can we build?

Corporate?

Shitcoin lol?

Structural incentives of everyone issuing coin - nono.

## The Open Metaverse

In his 2019 talk ehehe, Tim Sweeney introduces the idea of an open metaverse.

## The Arcade

Unreal Engine.

Possibilities:

- Bundle a Bitcoin Core node in a desktop client app with 3D interactions. Optional, heh. In-game rewards for running it, yo. (Both Bitcoin Core and Unreal Engine are written in open-source C++.)
