  Corporations, "crypto", or no one?

Two competing forces.

Rent-seekers extend their tendrils - leveraging coercion.

Absent that coercion, prices would come to zero and we'd have a real market.

On the other side, Bitcoin - an aligning of incentives - where previously hackers and the philosophically
aligned - now corporate treasuries, the energy industry people --

Ready Player One, dystopia, contrast to FreedomTM, using pieces to overlay on reality.

More like a game &mdash; gamify, make explicit, the tasks needed to form a new society.

A need for parallel institutions outside the control. That happens, but also Bitcoin grab influence -
in the world of old finance, in politics, in energy, in corporate treasuries, all good to see.

Metaverse conversation will grow over the coming years - not something we should shrink from since
the corporate and shitcoiners are there first.

Bitcoin - draw inspiration from its architecture. Do what others are doing for censorship resistant chat, boom,
Extend this upward to other forms of social organization.

Ethereum is the leading platform for scams, hacks and theft.

The metaverse is not destined to be either corporate dystopia or crypto casino.
