## Metaverse Money

From corporate treasuries to governments, from the energy industry to the political realm, Bitcoin's conquest of the physical world is accelerating.

Already on track to become the reserve currency of the world, Bitcoin is also best positioned to be the reserve currency of the metaverse.

<!-- What is the metaverse? It has no single definition. -->

In his article [Bitcoin Unlocks The Economy Of The Metaverse](https://thebitcoinlayer.substack.com/p/metaverse), author Nik Bhatia defines the metaverse as connective tissue for the internet's many virtual economies:

> The metaverse brings these worlds together. It’s a way of referring to the internet’s economy; a borderless bazaar of the weird and wonderful that can only exist virtually, and which may prove, in time, larger than the global economy itself. People who create content for the internet—bloggers, podcasters, YouTube personalities, Twitch streamers, and TikTok phenoms—are participants in the metaverse, as are their followers. What then is the potential size of the metaverse’s economy? Today, online commerce is still shackled by banking relics, but the limit has no bounds with bitcoin.

Bitcoin provides four crucial ingredients not found anywhere else:

1. A common denomination: "money for the internet"
2. Microtransactions via Lightning
3. Decentralized identity
4. Censorship resistance

With these building blocks from Bitcoin, what can we build?

## The Open Metaverse

In his 2019 talk [Foundational Principles & Technologies for the Metaverse](https://hackmd.io/@XR/tim-metaverse), Epic Games founder & CEO Tim Sweeney introduced the idea of the **open metaverse**:

> It’s a realtime 3D social medium where people can create and engage in shared experience as equal participants in an economy with societal impact.

The key phrase there is **equal participants**. Because otherwise, Sweeney says, this new medium could be:

> ...a potential invitation for a corporate dystopia like we have with a lot of the social media platforms now where one company sucks all the money out or most of it, and has the unilateral right to decide what can and should be seen in the thing.

We'll return to Sweeney's idea of the "metaverse as open platform" &mdash; this is the way!

Let us pause to ensure all future plans reflect the principle of openness &mdash; immunity to control &mdash;

Capture by corporations must be avoided at all costs!

To that end, building on Bitcoin is a must.

## Bitcoin First & Only

Capture by "crypto" must be avoided too.

If the metaverse shouldn't be run by Facebook, it certainly shouldn't be "run" by the leading platform for scams, fraud, hacks, and theft.

Nor should it be run by any other VC-backed shitcoins offering all the same bad incentives except faster and cheaper.

It is time for serious builders to prioritize building on Bitcoin.

## The Arcade

We'll implement our version of a Bitcoin-first metaverse, called The Arcade.

Envisioning a Bitcoin-first version of the corporate Oasis from Ready Player One.

|               | **The Oasis**      | **The Arcade**         |
| ------------- | ------------------ | ---------------------- |
| **Ownership** | Single corporation | Multi-stakeholder      |
| **Immersion** | Entirely virtual   | Mixed reality; AR > VR |
| **Emphasis**  | Escapism           | Real-world empowerment |
| **Code**      | Closed-source      | Open-source            |
| **Currency**  | Corporate shitcoin | Bitcoin                |

Unreal Engine.

Possibilities:

- Bundle a Bitcoin Core node in a desktop client app with 3D interactions. Optional, heh. In-game rewards for running it, yo. (Both Bitcoin Core and Unreal Engine are written in open-source C++.)
