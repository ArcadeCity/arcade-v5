## Metaverse Money

From corporate treasuries to governments, from the energy industry to the political realm, Bitcoin's conquest of the physical world is accelerating.

Already on track to become the reserve currency of the world, Bitcoin is also best positioned to be the reserve currency of the metaverse.

In his recent article Bitcoin Unlocks the Economy of the Metaverse, Layered Money author Nik Bhatia identifies a gap - lack of shared currency.

We'll add to that, a shared language of interoperability - not a necessity perhaps - much can be lubricated by boom boom - but a language for projects to work together. Epic for example is doing its part to have a shared language - with Epic Online Services - games, its own version. Roblox has its own version.

Certainly there are people in the Ethereum/shitcoin ecosystem working on "interoperability" -- problematic when everyone has their own token.

During the 2017-18 ICO hype cycle, we counted 15+ projects claiming they'd "decentralize ridesharing" - none of which reached out to us to collaborate - because they each had an incentive to put up a website and whitepaper and raise money for their own token. Those projects which in total raised millions of dollars created no products, gave no rides, and largely disappeared with the money.

It's hard to envision a different result now. The structural incentives of everyone building their own money printer do not lend themselves well to cooperation.

Contrast that to the quick cooperation we see in bitcoin - easier to boom, simpler integrations, smaller attack surface, innovation picking up quickly.

We predict that no combination of shitcoins will gain any meaningful, sustainable traction in building a metaverse. Sugar hype trains, built on shaky foundations. Not when over here we are building on stable foundation.

What might a Bitcoin version of this entail?

Imagine a metaverse powered by nodes . . . decentralized . . . voluntary association of actors - an open network, set of protocols and best practices, encoding things like reputation, blah blah.

We have our own opinions on how this will be built, and will be releasing our own implementation.

## Competition?

Bitcoin will be far more than a passive player.

<!-- It's no surprise why the Zuckerbergs and Buterins of the world hope to "run the metaverse" &mdash; what a glorious new canvas to extend -->

---

Two competing forces.

Rent-seekers extend their tendrils - leveraging coercion.

Absent that coercion, prices would come to zero and we'd have a real market.

On the other side, Bitcoin - an aligning of incentives - where previously hackers and the philosophically
aligned - now corporate treasuries, the energy industry people --

Ready Player One, dystopia, contrast to FreedomTM, using pieces to overlay on reality.

More like a game &mdash; gamify, make explicit, the tasks needed to form a new society.

A need for parallel institutions outside the control. That happens, but also Bitcoin grab influence -
in the world of old finance, in politics, in energy, in corporate treasuries, all good to see.

Metaverse conversation will grow over the coming years - not something we should shrink from since
the corporate and shitcoiners are there first.

Bitcoin - draw inspiration from its architecture. Do what others are doing for censorship resistant chat, boom,
Extend this upward to other forms of social organization.

Ethereum is the leading platform for scams, hacks and theft.

The metaverse is not destined to be either corporate dystopia or crypto casino.
